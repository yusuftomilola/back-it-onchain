App Concept — "Back It (Onchain)"

Speculation is as old as markets themselves — we all make calls.
Some whisper them to friends. Some tweet them into the void.
But what if you could back your words — literally?

Back It (Onchain) is a social platform for the new generation of market thinkers — a place where predictions, opinions, and hunches are not just noise, but signals that live on-chain.

Built on **Base** and **Stellar**, Back It lets you create or join call threads — bold statements about what you believe will happen in markets, culture, or technology.
Each call can be backed with a small onchain stake, turning speculation into a verifiable commitment.
Agree with someone's call? You can co-back it.
Disagree? Counter-back it — all transparently recorded on the blockchain.

No gambling. No casino-style odds.
Just conviction — expressed and proven in the open.

Each user's profile becomes their on-chain track record — a history of the calls they've made and backed. Over time, patterns emerge: who tends to see the future before it happens?

Back It transforms talk into traceable conviction — bringing honesty, reputation, and accountability back into online discourse.

Core Principles

🪙 On-Chain Accountability: Every prediction is paired with a verifiable transaction — proof that you mean it.

💬 Social, Not Speculative: Built like a forum — communities discuss and challenge calls in real time.

🌐 Multi-Chain Native: Choose your chain — Base (Ethereum L2) for EVM users, Stellar for fast/low-fee global transactions.

⚡ Powered by Base & Stellar: Fast, low-fee transactions on both chains ensure real-world usability and inclusivity.

📊 Reputation Through Accuracy: Your history becomes your proof — a public score of insight, not just opinion.

🤝 Social Graph: Follow top predictors, curate your feed, and build your own audience of backers.

💵 Native USDC: Stake with Circle's USDC on both chains — ERC-20 on Base, native asset on Stellar.
